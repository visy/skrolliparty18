This program was written in French.  The help screen (displayed when
LZEXE is executed without any arguments) is in French and cannot be
hacked into English because it's encrypted, compressed, etc.  The info
displayed is just a summary of the doc file.  The latter has been
translated very quickly into English.
It seems like a very useful and good program.  I tried it a few times,
and it worked flawlessly.

With the advent of UNLZEXE, I was able to translate most of the messages
in the LZEXE program suite into English.

I also was able to fix a bug that caused some programs to report "Invalid
drive specification" errors when lzexe'd  (DOS 3.3 XCOPY is an example of
such a program).

Original French executables and documentation are in subdirectory FRENCH.

Also included is UNLZEXE.EXE version 0.5 written by Mitugu(Kou) Kurizono.
