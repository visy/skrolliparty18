COMOTEXE.EXE v1.00 (c) Fabrice Bellard

This very simple program converts a COM (or BIN) file into an EXE file.  In
fact, it does exactly the reverse of what EXE2BIN does.  It is the ideal
complement of LZEXE, by the same author, since, thanks to COMTOEXE, LZEXE can
also compress COM files.

    Syntax:  COMTOEXE filename[.com] [filename2[.exe]]

where filename is the name of the COM file to be converted.  The COM extension
is added automatically by COMTOEXE.  The original COM file is NOT erased, for
safety sake.  The 'filename2' is optional.  If not added, the new EXE file will
have the same name.

N.B.  Some COM files may not work correctly after the conversions, because some
DOS programs, such as COMMAND.COM, may need to know the exact structure of the
file, and the conversion to an EXE file does modify this structure.
