	Documentation for:
		UPACKEXE.EXE  version 1.00 (c) 1989 Fabrice Bellard

	This program permits unpacking an EXE file packed with the Microsoft
	EXEPACK, so it can be compressed with LZEXE.  Otherwise, LZEXE can't
	do as good a job because EXEPACK's compression of the relocation
	table make it inacessible.

	How to use UPACKEXE:
	-------------------

	syntax:   UPACKEXE filename

	The original file's extent is changed to .OLD.  The new file is
	called UPACKEXE.TMP and is renamed after treated with LZEXE.
